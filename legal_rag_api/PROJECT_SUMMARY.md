# Legal RAG API - Project Summary

## Overview

We have successfully built a Django REST API for legal document Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that combines the power of OpenAI's large language models with optimized document chunking strategies and FAISS vector search to provide accurate responses to legal queries based on ingested documents.

## Key Components

### 1. Document Processing System

- **Document Storage**: Files are stored in the filesystem with unique identifiers
- **Text Extraction**: PDF and TXT files are processed to extract raw text
- **Semantic Chunking**: Documents are split into semantic chunks optimized for legal content
  - Uses recursive character splitting with appropriate separators for legal documents
  - Customizable chunk size (default: 750 tokens) and overlap (default: 150 tokens)
  - Preserves natural boundaries like paragraphs and sections

### 2. Vector Embedding & Search

- **FAISS Vector Store**: Fast, efficient storage and retrieval of document embeddings
- **OpenAI Embeddings**: Uses OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small for high-quality embeddings
- **Metadata Storage**: Each chunk's metadata (document source, position, etc.) is preserved
- **Persistence**: Embeddings are saved to disk for reuse across server restarts

### 3. RAG Pipeline

- **Document Ingestion**: Upload → Extract → Chunk → Embed → Index
- **Semantic Search**: Convert query to embedding → Find similar chunks
- **Context Building**: Retrieve and format content from most relevant chunks
- **LLM Response Generation**: Pass query and context to GPT-4o for accurate answers
- **Source Attribution**: Includes document references and relevance scores with responses

### 4. API Endpoints

- **Document Management API**: CRUD operations for documents
- **Ingestion API**: Upload and process documents
- **Query API**: Ask questions and get answers with source information

### 5. Data Models

- **Document**: Stores document metadata and processing status
- **Chunk**: Stores document chunks with content and embedding status
- **Query**: Tracks user queries for analytics

## Technical Highlights

1. **Optimized for Legal Documents**: Chunking strategy and prompts designed for legal content
2. **Performance Metrics**: Tracks and reports time for retrieval and LLM processing
3. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with modular design
4. **Database Integration**: Document and chunk metadata stored in SQLite (or any Django-supported DB)
5. **Admin Interface**: Django admin for easy document and chunk management
6. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and status tracking

## Deployment and Testing

- **Development Server**: Ready for local testing
- **Test Script**: Automated script for testing API functionality
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and Quick Start guide

## Future Improvements

- **Reranking**: Implement cross-encoder reranking for better retrieval accuracy
- **More Document Formats**: Support for DOCX, HTML, and other formats
- **Authentication**: User authentication and document access controls
- **Web UI**: Frontend interface for document management and querying
- **Production Deployment**: Containerization and deployment guides

## Conclusion

The Legal RAG API provides a robust foundation for legal tech applications that need to extract information from documents. The combination of semantic chunking optimized for legal texts, efficient vector search, and OpenAI's language models creates a powerful system for answering complex legal questions with proper source attribution.
